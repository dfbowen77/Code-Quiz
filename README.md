# Code Quiz
The repo for my Code Quiz Challenge Submission 

## Description
The following webpage is designed to meet the requirements of the Module 4 Challenge. It represents the beginnings of a quiz app for aspiring coders. Users are given instructions and presented with a start button. They are then given a timed 5-item coding quiz. Each time an item is answered correctly they move to a new item; each time an item is answered incorrectly ten seconds are deducted from their score. Upon completion, they log their initials, and can view their results on a high score table. Screen shots are presented below of each major component of this web app.
